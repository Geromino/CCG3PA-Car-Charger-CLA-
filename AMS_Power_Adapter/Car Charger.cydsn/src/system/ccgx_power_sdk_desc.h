 * @section TypeCIntro Introduction
 *
 * USB Type-C is the new USB-IF standard that solves several challenges faced
 * when using today's Type-A and Type-B cables and connectors. USB Type-C uses
 * a slimmer connector (measuring only 2.4-mm in height) to allow for
 * increasing miniaturization of consumer and industrial products. The USB
 * Type-C standard is gaining rapid support by enabling small form-factor,
 * easy-to-use connectors and cables with the ability to transmit multiple
 * protocols and offer power delivery up to 100 W – a significant improvement
 * over the 7.5 W possible using previous standards.
 *
 * @subsection TypeCFeatures USB Type-C Highlights
 * - Brand new reversible connector, measuring only 2.4-mm in height.
 * - Compliant with USB Power Delivery 2.0, providing up to 100 W.
 * - Double the bandwidth of USB 3.0, increasing to 10 Gbps with SuperSpeedPlus
 *   USB3.1.
 * - Combines multiple protocols in a single cable, including DisplayPort™,
 *   PCIe® or Thunderbolt™.
 *
 * @section CCGIntro Cypress EZ-PD™ Type-C Controllers
 *
 * Cypress provides the EZ-PD™ family of USB Type-C controllers which can help
 * implement various Type-C applications. Cypress’s Type-C controllers are
 * based on Cypress’s PSoC® 4 programmable system-on-chip architecture, which
 * includes programmable analog and digital blocks, an ARM® Cortex®-M0 core and
 * 32 to 128 KB of flash memory.
 *
 * This product family is driving the industry’s first Type-C products with
 * top-tier PC makers, enabling them to bring these USB Type-C benefits to
 * market. Cypress has reference designs readily available for EMCA and dongle
 * applications. These are available online and could be used to speed-up our
 * customers design cycle.
 *
 * @subsection CCGFamily CCGx Product Families

 * @section CCGFwStack CCGx Firmware Stack
 *
 * The CCGx product families are supported by a robust firmware stack which
 * includes:
 * -# USB Type-C and USB-PD specification compliant PD stack.
 * -# Drivers for the various hardware blocks on the CCGx controllers.
 * -# Implementation of USB based charging protocols including BC 1.2,
 *    Apple charging, Qualcomm Quick Charge and Adaptive Fast Charging.
 * -# Implementation of system protection schemes that handle power supply,
 *    load and temperature related fault conditions.
 *
 * The CCGx firmware stack is compliant to the:
 * - USB-PD Specification Revision 3.0
 * - Type-C Specification Revision 1.3
 *
 * This version of the CCGx Firmware Stack supports the CCG3PA device family 
 * and is targeted at implementing USB-PD power adapter and power bank applications.
 *
 * Please refer to the CCGx Host SDK for stack and code examples for implementing
 * USB-PD controller for notebook, desktop and mobile systems.
 *
 * @subsection FwDirStruct Firmware Stack Organization
 *
 * The CCGx firmware stack is provided in source form with the SDK. The firmware
 * files are organized into the following directory structure:
 *
 * - system: The system folder contains header and source files relating to the
 *   CCGx device hardware and registers, boot-loader and flash access functions,
 *   low level drivers for the GPIO and USB-PD blocks on the CCGx device, and a
 *   soft timer implementation that is used by the firmware stack.
 *
 * - pd_hal: The pd_hal folder contains the Hardware Adaptation Layer (HAL) or
 *   low level hardware driver for the USB-PD hardware in the CCGx device.
 *   The driver functionality include PD block initialization, USB-PD message
 *   handling code, interrupt handling and ADC/Comparator configuration.
 *
 * - pd_common: The pd_common folder contains the core Type-C and USB-PD stack
 *   for the CCGx device. This includes the the Type-C port manager, the USB-PD
 *   protocol layer, the USB-PD policy engine and the Device Policy Manager.
 *   On devices that dual USB-PD ports, the stack allows both of the ports
 *   to function and be managed in a completely independent manner.
 *   The PD stack is provided in library form, and hence this folder will
 *   only contain the header files that define the stack interfaces.
 *
 * - app: The app folder contains the top-level application layer functionality
 *   that implements the USB-PD controller functions required. This includes
 *   functionality such as PDO evaluation and contract negotiation, handling of
 *   control messages like role swap and legacy battery charging.
 *
 * - cable_comp: The cable_comp contains the functions associated with supply
 *   voltage compensation for voltage drop across the circuit from power source
 *   to the device being charged.
 *
 * @page FwStackDesc CCGx Firmware Architecture
 *
 * The CCGx firmware solution allows users to implement a variety of USB-PD
 * applications using the CCG devices and a fully tested firmware stack.
 *
 * The CCGx firmware solution contains the following components:
 *
 * - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): This includes the low level drivers for the
 *   various hardware blocks on the CCG device. This includes drivers for the
 *   Type-C and USB-PD block, Serial Communication Blocks (SCBs), GPIOs, flash
 *   module and timer module.
 *
 * - USB Type-C and USB-PD Protocol Stack: This is the complete USB-PD protocol
 *   stack that includes the Type-C and USB-PD port managers, USB-PD protocol layer,
 *   the USB-PD policy engine and the device policy manager. The device policy
 *   manager is designed to allow all policy decisions to be made at the application
 *   level, either on an external Embedded Controller (EC) or in the CCG firmware
 *   itself.
 *
 * - Port Management: This module handles all of the PD port management functions
 *   including the algorithm for optimal contract negotiations, source and sink
 *   power control, source voltage selection, port role assignment and swap
 *   request handling.
 *
 * - Low Power: This module attempts to keep the CCG device in the low power
 *   standby mode as often as possible to minimize power consumption.
 *
 * - External Hardware Control: This is an hardware design dependent module which
 *   controls the external hardware blocks such as FETs, regulators and Type-C
 *   switches.
 *
 * - Solution specific tasks: This is an application layer module where any custom
 *   tasks required by the user solution can be implemented.
 *
 * A block diagram of the CCGx firmware architecture is shown below.
